<h1>pvDatabaseCPP</h1>
<h2 class="nocount">Release 4.2 - 2016.01.12</h2>


<h2 class="nocount">Abstract</h2>

<p>This document describes pvDatabaseCPP,
which is a framework for implementing a network accessible database of smart memory resident
records. Network access is via pvAccess. The data in each record is a top level PVStructure as defined by
pvData. The framework includes a complete implementation of ChannelProvider as defined by pvAccess.
The framework can be extended in order to create record instances that implements services.
The minimum that an extension must provide is a top level PVStructure and a process method.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this project to make it easier to implement services that are accessed via pvAccess.
This project supplies a complete implementation of the server side of pvAccess.
All that a service has to provide is a top level PVStructure and a process method.
A service can be run as a main process or can be part of a V3 IOC.
Thus services can be developed that interact with V3 records, asynDriver,
areaDetector, etc.
</p>

<p>A brief description of a pvDatabase is that it is a set of network accessible, smart,
memory resident records.
Each record has data composed of a top level PVStructure.
Each record has a name which is the channelName for pvAccess.
A local Channel Provider implements the complete ChannelProvider and
Channel interfaces as defined by pvAccess.
The local provider provides access to the records in the pvDatabase.
This local provider is accessed by the remote pvAccess server.
A record is smart because code can be attached to a record, which is accessed via a method named process.</p>

<p>This document describes components that provide the following features:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>database</dt>
     <dd>This encapsulates the concept of a database of memory resident smart records.
        The two main components are:
       <dl>
          <dt>pvRecord</dt>
             <dd>This encapsulates the concept of a smart record. It can be processed.
             Changes to field values can be trapped. A record can be locked.</dd>
          <dt>pvDatabase</dt>
              <dd>This is a database of pvRecords.
               Records can be added and removed from a database.</dd>
       </dl>
     </dd>
  <dt>pvAccess</dt>
     <dd>This is a complete implementation of ChannelProvider and Channel
       as defined by pvAccess.
       It is used by the server side of pvAccess to attach to pvRecords.
       </dd>
   <dt>Main and V3IOC</dt>
      <dd>The pvDatabase can be provided via a Main program or can be part
       of a V3IOC. In the later case the IOC has both a database of V3 Records
      and a pvDatabase.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Base classes make it easy to create record instances.
The code attached to each record must create the top
level PVStructure and the following three methods:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>init</dt>
    <dd>This is a method for initializing the support.
     It returns true if successful and false otherwise.
    </dd>
  <dt>process</dt>
    <dd>This is what makes a record smart.
     </dd>
  <dt>destroy</dt>
     <dd>This releases and resources used by the implementation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Doxygen documentation is available at <a
href="./html/index.html">doxygenDoc</a></p>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>The first step is to build pvDatabaseCPP as described in the next section.</p>
<p>A separate project <b>exampleCPP</b> has examples for <b>pvDatabaseCPP</b>
and for <b>pvaClientCPP</b>.
See it for examples.
</p>

<h3>Features Required for localChannelProvider</h3>
<dl>
   <dt>copy and monitor</dt>
      <dd>pvDataCPP provides facilities copy and monitor.
         This facilities allow a client to access an arbitrary subset
          of the fields in the top level structure associated with a channel,
        and to monitor changes in the top level structure.
        pvDatabaseCPP uses what pvDataCPP provides and has code that
       associates these facilities with a PVRecord.
       </dd>
   <dt>PVRecord and PVDatabase</dt>
      <dd>Defined below.</dd>
   <dt>The localChannelProvider itself</dt>
     <dd>
       The localChannelProvider accesses data from PVRecords.
     It implements all channel methods except channelRPC,
      which is implemented by pvAccessCPP.
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Features Required for pvRecord</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>PVDatabase</dt>
      <dd>This holds a set of PVRecords.
         It has methods to find, add, and remove records.</dd>
  <dt>PVRecord</dt>
     <dd>This, and a set of related interfaces, provides the following:
        <dl>
           <dt>Access to top level PVStructure</dt>
             <dd>PVRecord is a wrapper on a top level pvStructure.</dd>
           <dt>Record locking</dt>
              <dd>A record can be locked and unlocked.
              A record must be locked whenever data in the pvStructure is accessed.
               </dd>
           <dt>Trapping data changes</dt>
             <dd>A client can request to be notified when data in the pvStructure
              is modified.
             It can do this on a field by field basis.</dd>
            <dt>A method named process</dt>
             <dd>
               <p>The process method is called when a pvAccess client requests that a record be processed.
                  If a top level timeStamp field exists,
                  the default process method just sets the timeStamp to the currect time.
                  A service is created by implementing process and providing a top level PVStructure.
                </p>
             </dd>
        </dl>
     </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Building pvDatabaseCPP</h2>
<p>To build pvDatabaseCPP You must provide a file RELEASE.local
in directory configure.
Thus do the following:</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; pwd
/home/hg/pvDatabaseCPP/configure
mrk&gt; cp ExampleRELEASE.local RELEASE.local
</pre>
<p>Then edit <b>RELEASE.local</b> so that it has the correct location of each
product pvDatabaseCPP requires.
Than at the top level just execute <b>make</b>:</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; cd ..
mrk&gt; pwd
/home/epicsv4/master/pvDatabaseCPP
mrk&gt; make
</pre>
<p>This builds pvDatabase and also test.</p>
<p>test is a completely separate top,
but is also built when  make is run in pvDatabaseCPP itself.</p>

<h2>iocshell commands</h2>
<p>Shell commands are made available via the standard DBD include mechanism
provided by iocCore.
The following provide EPICS V4 shell commands:</p>
<pre>
pvAccessCPP
pvaSrv
pvDatabaseCPP
</pre>

<p>pvDatabaseCPP provides the following iocshell command.</p>
<dl>
   <dt>pvdbl</dt>
      <dd>Provides a list of all the pvRecords in database <b>master</b>
      </dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition any code that implements a PVRecord must implement an ioc command.
Look at any of the examples in <b>exampleCPP</b> to see how to implement shell commands.</p>

<h2>database</h2>
<h3>src/database</h3>
<p>This Directory has the following files:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>pvDatabase.h</dt>
     <dd>
      This is what is described in this section.
     </dd>
   <dt>pvDatabase.cpp</dt>
     <dd>
       The implementation of PVDatabase.
     </dd>
   <dt>pvRecord.cpp</dt>
     <dd>
       The implementation of the base class for PVRecord.
       It can also implement record instances with a process
       method does nothing.
       This can be used to create a "dumb" record where all changes are
       done by clients.
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>src/special</h3>
<p>This directory has the following files:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>traceRecord.h</dt>
     <dd>This implements a PVRecord that can set the trace level for
     another record. See below for a discussion of trace level.</dd>

</dl>
<h3>pvDatabase.h</h3>
<p>The classes in pvDatabase.h describe a database of memory resident
smart records.
It describes the following classes:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>PVRecord</dt>
     <dd>This provides the methods required by localChannelProvider to implement Channel.</dd>
   <dt>PVRecordField</dt>
   <dt>PVRecordStructure</dt>
     <dd>These wrap PVField and PVStructure so that pvCopy and monitor
        can be implemented.</dd>
   <dt>PVRecordClient</dt>
      <dd>This is called by anything that accesses PVRecord.</dd>
   <dt>PVListener</dt>
      <dd>This is implemented by anything that wants to trap calls to PVRecord::message.</dd>
   <dt>PVDatabase</dt>
      <dd>This is a database of PVRecords.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each class is described in a separate subsection.</p>
<h3>C++ namespace and typedefs</h3>

</pre>

<h3>class PVRecord</h3>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ul>
    <li>This section uses the name record instead of "an instance of PVRecord".</li>
    <li>Most clients will access a record via the local channel provider,
       i. e. via pvAccess.
        Thus this section is mainly of interest to 
      the local channel provider and record implementers.</li>
    <li>Most readers will not care about most of the PVRecord methods.
       Most of the methods are used by the pvAccess code.
      Service implementers will mostly be interested in methods init and process.
      These are described first.
    </li>

<h2>pvAccess</h2>
<p>This is code that provides an implementation of channelProvider as
defined by pvAccess.
It provides access to PVRecords and is accessed by the server side of remote pvAccess.
It uses the copy and monitor facilities from pvDataCPP and connects
them to a PVRecord.
</p>
<p>The implementation is a complete implementation of channelProvider
and channel except for channelRPC, which is implement by pvAccess as a separate
channel provider.</p>
<p>The following provides a brief description of each channel method that
is implemented.</p>
<h3>channelProcessLocal</h3>
<p>Needs to be described.</p>
<h3>channelGetLocal</h3>
<p>Needs to be described.</p>
<h3>channelPutLocal</h3>
<p>Needs to be described.</p>
<h3>channelPutGetLocal</h3>
<p>Needs to be described.</p>
<h3>channelArrayLocal</h3>
<p>Needs to be described.</p>
<h3>MonitorLocal</h3>
<p>This is the code that implements monitors on changes to fields of a PVRecord.
Because it is called by pvAccess client (monitor methods) and by
PVRecord (when postPut is called), it must be careful to prevent deadlocks.
The implementation is via class MonitorLocal (implemented in monitorFactory.cpp)
and PVCopyMonitor.
MonitorLocal is the interface between pvAccess and PVCopyMonitor.
PVCopyMonitor is the interface between MonitorLocal and PVRecord.
MonitorLocal manages a MonitorElement queue.
While monitoring is active (between start and stop) it keeps an active element
for use by PVCopyMonitor.
While monitoring is active PVCopyMonitor updates the active monitor element whenever
a postPut is issued to any field being monitored.
</p>
<p>The following two sections provide a few more details about MonitorLocal
and PVCopyMonitor.</p>
<h4>MonitorLocal</h4>
<p>MonitorLocal implements the following abstract base classes:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Monitor</dt>
     <dd>This is described by pvDataCPP.
     It has methods start, stop, poll, and release.
      These methods are called by the pvAccess client
     </dd>
  <dt>PVCopyMonitorRequester</dt>
     <dd>This has methods releaseActiveElement and unlisten.
      These methods are called by PVCopyMonitor.
     </dd>
</dl>
MonitorLocal manages the following:
<dl>
  <dt>MonitorElementQueue</dt>
    <dd>This is a queue of monitor elements.
     A Queue is implemented by pvDataCPP and used by MonitorLocal.
     It is a finite queue.
     A monitor element is described by pvDataCPP.
     It has fields pvStructure, changedBitSet, and overrunBitSet.
     The pvStructure holds data for a subset of the fields in a PVRecord.
     The changedBitSet and overrunBitSet describe changes between
      monitor event.
      MonitorLocal creates an instance of PVCopy (implemented by pvDataCPP),
      which manages the interaction between the set of fields being
      monitored and the fields in the top level PVStructure of the PVRecord.
      pvCopy is also used to create the pvStructure for each monitor element.
      </dd>
  <dt>activeElement</dt>
    <dd>Whenever monitoring is active monitorLocal
     keeps an active element for use by pvCopyMonitor.
     It changes the active element based on calls to poll (by the
     client) and calls to releaseActiveElement (by pvCopyMonitor).
     If there are no free element when releaseActiveElement is
     called the current active element is returned.
     If a free element is available the client is notified that a new
      monitor element is available and the free element becomes the
    active element.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>A brief description on each method in MonitorLocal is:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>start</dt>
     <dd>
        Called by client.
        With a lock held it clears the monitorElement queue
       and allocates an active element.
      With no lock held calls pvCopyMonitor-&gt;startMonitoring(activeElement)
     </dd>
   <dt>stop</dt>
      <dd>
        Called by client.
      With no lock held calls pvCopyMonitor-&gt;stopMonitoring(activeElement)
      </dd>
   <dt>poll</dt>
      <dd>
        Called by client.
       With a lock held it calls queue-&gt;getUsed();
      </dd>
   <dt>release</dt>
      <dd>
        Called by client.
       With a lock held it calls queue-&gt;releaseUsed();
      </dd>
   <dt>releaseActiveElement</dt>
      <dd>
       Called by PVCopyMonitor with no locks held.
       With a lock held it tries to get a new free element.
       If it can't it just returns the current active element.
       Otherwise it does the following.
       Using the activeElement it updates the pvStructure
        and compresses the changed and overrun bitSet.
       It then calls queue-&gt;setUsed(activeElement);
       It then sets the active element to the new free element.
        With no lock held it calls monitorRequester-&gt;monitorEvent(getPtrSelf())
       and finally returns the new active element,
      </dd>
   <dt>unlisten</dt>
      <dd>
       With no lock held it calls monitorRequester-&gt;unlisten(getPtrSelf());
      </dd>
</dl>
<h4>PVCopyMonitor</h4>
<p>
pvCopyMonitor is the code that manages changes to
fields in the record.
It is called by PVRecord whenever a postPut is issued to a field.
pvCopyMonitor uses the active monitor element provided by monitorFactory.
Note that this method is called with the record locked.
It only modifies the changedBitSet and overrunBitSet of the
active element but never modifies the pvStructure.
</p>
<p>A brief description of the pvCopyMonitor methods is:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>startMonitoring</dt>
     <dd>With no lock held it sets its monitorElement to the
     startElement passed by monitorLocal and calls pvRecord-&gt;addListener(getPtrSelf()).
     It locks the pvRecord.
      It calls calls addListener for every field in the record that is being
      monitored.
     It clears the overrun and changed bit sets.
     It sets bit 0 of the changed bit set and calls
     pvCopyMonitorRequester-&gt;releaseActiveElement();
     Thus the client will get the initial values for every field being monitored.
     The record is unlocked and the method returns to the caller.
      </dd>
  <dt>stopMonitoring</dt>
     <dd>
      With no lock held it calls pvRecord-&gt;removeListener(getPtrSelf());
     </dd>
  <dt>dataPut</dt>
     <dd>
      This is called because of a call to postPut.
      It is called with the record locked.
      It updates the changed and overrun bitSets.
      It isGroupPut is false it calls
      pvCopyMonitorRequester-&gt;releaseActiveElement().
      Otherwise it sets dataChanged true.
     </dd>
  <dt>beginGroupPut</dt>
     <dd>
      With a lock held it
      sets isGroupPut true and dataChanged false.
     </dd>
  <dt>endGroupPut</dt>
     <dd>
      With a lock held it sets isGroupPut false.
      With no lock held and dataChanged true it calls
      pvCopyMonitorRequester-&gt;releaseActiveElement()
     </dd>
  <dt>unlisten</dt>
     <dd>
      Just calls pvCopyMonitorRequester-&gt;unlisten();
     </dd>
</dl>

<h2>special</h2>
<p>This section provides two useful record support modules
and one that is used for testing.</p>
<h3>traceRecord</h3>
<p>This implements a PVRecord that allows a client to set
the trace level of a record. It follows the pattern of a channelPutGet
record:</p>
<pre>
traceRecord
    structure argument
        string recordName 
        int level 0
    structure result
        string status 
</pre>
where:
<dl>
   <dt>recordName</dt>
     <dd>The name of the record to set the trace level.</dd>
   <dt>level</dt>
      <dd>The level to set. The meaning is:
        <dl>
          <dt>0</dt>
             <dd>No trace messages generated</dd>
          <dt>1</dt>
           <dd>Lifecycle messages will be generated.
            This all channel create and destroy instances will be shown.</dd>
          <dt>2</dt>
            <dd>In addition to lifecycle messages a message will be generated
             for each get and put request.</dd>
          <dt>&gt;2</dt>
            <dd>Currently no definition</dd>
        </dl>
     </dd>
   <dt>result</dt>
      <dd>The result of a cannelPutGet request</dd>
</dl>
<p>testExampleServerMain.cpp has an example of how to create a traceRecord:</p>
<pre>
PVDatabasePtr master = PVDatabase::getMaster();
PVRecordPtr pvRecord;
String recordName;
bool result(false);
recordName = "traceRecordPGRPC";
pvRecord = TraceRecord::create(recordName);
result = master-&gt;addRecord(pvRecord);
if(!result) cout&lt;&lt; "record " &lt;&lt; recordName &lt;&lt; " not added" &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>
